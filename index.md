## 🗞 News
- **[2025.07]** We release [**InteriorGS**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/spatialverse/InteriorGS), a high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting dataset of 1,000 richly annotated indoor scenes!  
  InteriorGS bridges the gap between scan-based and artist-designed datasets by combining photorealistic rendering with 3DGS reconstruction from over 5 million images. It includes:
  - 554,000+ object instances across 755 categories
  - Per-object semantic labels and 3D bounding boxes
  - Occupancy maps for agent navigation
  - 80+ environment types (e.g., homes, museums, convenience stores)

  The dataset supports research in 3D scene understanding, controllable generation, and embodied AI. A web-based viewer is also available for exploring the data.
